 * TeacherInfo.java
 * 
 * Pseudocode
 * 
 *  import Scannner and java.io.*
 * 	Declare Field Variables (Three arrays, scores[], grades[], teacherData[])
 * 	TeacherInfo()
 *   - Initialize arrays 
 * 		- scores[101]: Number of Grades for each number from 1 to 100
 * 		- grades[5]: Number of Grades for Each Category: A, B, C, D, F
 * 		- teacherData[3]: Teacher Name, Course Number, and Course Name
 * 
 *  main()
 * 	- create an instance of TeacherInfo
 * 	- use instance to call runIt()
 * 
 * 	runIt()
 * 	 - fake main, calls all the methods
 *
 * askUser()
 * 	 - Asks user for the Teacher's file name including ".txt" 
 * 	 - Asks user for the course Number
 *	 - Sends the user input to decideNumbers()
 * 
 * 	openIt()
 * 	 - Looks for the File and opens it, if can't find file throw error using try...catch method
 * 
 * decideNumbers()
 * 	 - Stores the words after "Teacher:" stores everything into teacherData[0] until the String ends and it reaches "Class:"
 * 	 - Stores the words after "Class:" stores the course name into teacherData[1]
 *   - Stores the words after course name stores everything into teacherData[2] until the String ends and it reaches "Room:"
 * 
 * 	 - Put the grades into the correct place in the array
 * 	 	- First, decide where to add the number in scores[]
 * 		- Second, decide where to add the number in grades[]
 * 		- Put the data for Teacher Name, Course Number, and Room Number into the correct place for teacherData[]
 * 
 * makeIt()
 * 	- creates the file and adds "-results.txt" at the end of the file name
 * 
 * printItConsole()
 *	- prints the data to the console
 * 
 * printItTXT()
 *  - prints the data to the txt file
